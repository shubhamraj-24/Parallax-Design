The parallax effect is a popular web design technique that creates a sense of depth and immersion by moving different layers of content at different speeds as the user scrolls down a web page. It's achieved using HTML and CSS, and here's a description of how it can be done:

Structure the HTML: Start by structuring the HTML code of your web page into different sections, each containing a different layer of content. For example, you might have a header section, a main content section, and a footer section.

Create the CSS: In your CSS file, set the background image of each section to a different image. You can then adjust the position of the image to create the parallax effect. For example, for the header section, set the background-position to "center top", and for the main content section, set it to "center center".

Add scrolling effects: To create the parallax effect, you'll need to add scrolling effects to each section. You can do this by using CSS animations or transitions, which will move the background image at a different speed than the content in the foreground.

Adjust the speed: Experiment with different speeds for each section to create a more realistic parallax effect. Generally, you'll want the background images in the foreground sections to move faster than those in the background sections.

Test and refine: Test your parallax effect by scrolling up and down the page, and adjust the speed and positioning of each section as needed until you achieve the desired effect.

Overall, creating a parallax effect using HTML and CSS requires careful planning and experimentation. But with some patience and creativity, you can create a truly immersive and engaging web experience for your users.
